# Dart serialization example

Example of how to transfer Dart classes with the serialization package.

This example uses hand-written serialization rules and immutable DTO classes.

To run the example, both the client and the server need to be started.

In Webstorm you can do this directly as two launches.

If you are using a text-editor, you can use the command-line.
Make the current directory the root of the project and execute:

```
pub serve
pub run bin/server.dart
```

Once it is running, open a web-browser to or to the pub server port (http://localhost:8080) and press the button.
